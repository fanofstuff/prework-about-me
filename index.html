      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Taking the world by storm, fresh from college, and happy to be back state-side, I'm Tucker. Nice to meet you! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Toronto, Canada, but raised for most of my life in humble Kennesaw, Georgia. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Given the chance, I like nothing more than to kick back with a good book, a meaty RPG, or, schedule-willing, a session of DnD. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My ideal job would give me plenty of freedom to tackle new and interesting problems, schmooze with my coworkers, and pay me generously for my time. Here's hoping I'm heading towards just such an outcome, hmm? </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently with my parents, though that should be just until my Graduate School program in the Fall. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Plainly, my college dissertation was focused around the impact of automation and advancing technology upon the job sector. What I found didn't inspire much long-term confidence for most industries, though it did reveal the critical importance of cyber-security. More practically, the field pays well (generally), and Tech is offering a Graduate degree in Cyber Security, which fits my undergraduate in International Relations fairly well. </p>
